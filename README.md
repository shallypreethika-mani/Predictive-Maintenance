**Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machines**

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on predicting machine failures using a dataset containing 10,000 records with 14 features related to machine operating conditions. The dataset includes various machine parameters such as temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear, along with a binary classification label indicating machine failure. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to build a predictive maintenance model that can forecast failures and minimize downtime in industrial settings. I have used the ML algorithm such as Random Forest and logistic regression.
